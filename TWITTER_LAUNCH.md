**Tweet 2:**
Why I built this:

I was tired of switching between Obsidian (notes) and Jupyter (code).

Now I can mix:
• Code experiments
• Explanations
• AI prompts
• Data analysis

All in one place 🔥

**Tweet 3:**
Example workflow:

```python
# Learn by doing
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
sum(x)
```

Output appears inline ⚡

Variables persist across blocks 🧠

ChatGPT as a "code block" 🤖

Perfect for computational notes!
